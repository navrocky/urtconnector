HOW TO MAKE DISTRIBUTION
========================

1. RPM 
2. Debian
3. Gentoo
4. Windows


1. RPM distribution
===================

    1) Requirements to build: make, cmake >= 2.6-patch6, g++, qt4 >= 4.3, qt4-devel, boost, boost-devel >= 1.36.
    2) Take sources from svn repository, or download a tarball.
    3) Extract sources. Note that root folder of sources must be named as "urtconnector".
    4) In console run command: 
        > cd urtconnector/distrib/rpm 
        > ./build_rpm
    5) Resulting RPM package placed near sources root folder.
    6) Install package:
        > sudo rpm -ivh urtconnector-x.x.x-x.xxx.rpm
    7) Enjoy!


2. Debian distribution
======================

    1) Requirements to build: make, cmake >= 2.6-patch6, g++, qt4 >= 4.3, qt4-devel, boost, boost-devel >= 1.36.

        > cd urtconnector/distrib/deb 
        > ./build_deb.sh
    5) Resulting deb package placed at deb folder.
    6) Install package:
        > sudo dpkg -i *
    7) Enjoy!


3. Gentoo
=========
    1) Put distrib/gentoo/*.ebuild to your working overlay.
    	> mkdir -p /usr/local/portage/layman/xxx/games-fps/urtconnector
    	> cp distrib/gentoo/*.ebuild /usr/local/portage/layman/xxx/games-fps/urtconnector
    2) Unmask games-fps/urtconnector atom if needed
        > echo games-fps/urtconnector /etc/portage/package.keywords/urtconnector
	> echo games-fps/urtconnector /etc/portage/package.unmask/urtconnector
    3) Create manifest for atom
        > ebuild /usr/local/portage/layman/xxx/games-fps/urtconnector/*.ebuild manifest
    4) Emerge urtconnector
        > emerge urtconnector
    5) Enjoy!
